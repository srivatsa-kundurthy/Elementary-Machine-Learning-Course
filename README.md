# Elementary Machine Learning Course
Resources from a Machine Learning Course taught in Summer and Winter 2021. The program is geared towards upper elementary and middle school students who have limited exposure to higher level math and programming skills, but are interested in the field. The primary goal is to establish a strong foundation and understanding of high-level concepts.  
It's actually harder to teach those with no experience than to instruct someone with a background in the field. Therefore, I was incredibly humbled by the interest and level of comprehension I was able to bring to these students.  
I invite all prospective teachers to fork this repository and make changes!
